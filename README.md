Phase 2 Self Assessment
=======================

Welcome to the Phase Two Self Assessment. At this point in Phase Two, you should have the skills to complete this challenge. Please give yourself a time box of 3 hours to work on this. Commit early and often.

If you don't finish this challenge in three hours, be sure to make a clear, concise commit at the end of three hours then feel free to continue working after time is up.

Note: We don't expect you to have all the skills committed to memory right now. Use all the resources you've accumulated over the past week!

Good luck!
